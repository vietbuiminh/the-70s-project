# The 70s - The Decade of Turmoil

Link to our [Website](https://the70s.netlify.app/).

## Inspiration
The inspiration was from Wikipedia and Mapbox. We want to see it fusing and turn out with a beautiful website.
## What it does
It shows all the wars that happened around the world in the 70s. We have around 21 wars and in each war, we have a description and which year it happened and where did it happen showing it in the Mapbox 
## How we built it
We built that using Mapbox API, React, JSON data and some Html and CSS.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into combining all the pages and rendering them. We also had to get all the coordinates in the JSON file of each war. It was time-taking. However, the skeleton of the JSON file was scrapped from the Wikipedia page.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we can successfully show the popup which took around 12hrs.
## What we learned
Learned to use React MapBox GL API.
It was an amazing experience by far. MLH hackathons are very intriguing for their themes.
## What's next for The 70s
We are looking forward to bring information about the wars that happened in the past and adding some cool features to it.
